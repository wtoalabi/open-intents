# open-intents
The purpose of this project is to help developers seed some simple, general purpose nlu intents as fast as possible. Specifically, this is meant for the RASA communities, but anyone in the NLU space can also find it useful.

While nothing beats the efficiency you get from putting your bot in the hands of your users as fast as possible, with this project, we hope you get a fair head-start.

Lets us crowd-source the data. 

Go through and submit pull-requests for some general-purposed intents you have collated on your own, while you also pick the ones we all gather for you.

This should be fun.

Lets go!
